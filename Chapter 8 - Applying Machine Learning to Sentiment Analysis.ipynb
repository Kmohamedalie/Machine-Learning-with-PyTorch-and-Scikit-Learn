For example, a typical application is the categorization of documents in a large text corpus of newspaper articles. In applications of topic modeling, we then aim to assign category labels to those articles, for example, sports, finance, world news, politics, and local news. Thus, in the context of the broad categories of machine learning that we discussed in Chapter 1, Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data, we can consider topic modeling as a clustering task, a subcategory of unsupervised learning.\n","In this section, we will discuss a popular technique for topic modeling called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
